# iconic-lib
A set of code assets and systems to assist with our needs and yours.

## CustomProximityPrompts
A client-sided ProximityPrompt wrapper made entirely with Fusion.
You can see a showcase of it [here](https://twitter.com/iGottic_Real/status/1759282721744998633).
This system is extremely flexible due to the component-based nature of it. [Here](https://twitter.com/iGottic_Real/status/1759597465156600268) is an example of that.
